However, the concept ‘polycentric city’ has a fuzzy definition and as a result, the extent to which a city is polycentric cannot be easily determined. Here, we leverage the fine spatio-temporal resolution of smart travel card data to infer urban polycentricity by examining how a city departs from a well-defined monocentric model. In particular, we analyse the human movements that arise as a result of sophisticated forms of urban structure by introducing a novel probabilistic approach which captures the complexity of these human movements. We focus on London (UK) and Seoul (South Korea) as our two case studies, and we specifically find evidence that London displays a higher degree of monocentricity than Seoul, suggesting that Seoul is likely to be more polycentric than London."

Our results show that there is no significant change in the number of road traffic collisions per person for urban areas of different sizes.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Scaling laws are used to model how different quantifiable properties of cities, such as the number of road traffic accidents or average house prices, vary as a function of city population size, with parameters estimated from data. Arcaute et al. raised the issue of whether specific cities with extremely large population sizes, known as dragon-kings, should be considered separately from other smaller cities when estimating the scaling law parameters since the two types of cities tend to display different behaviour. Through the analysis of randomly generated samples, we find that the inclusion of dragon-kings in the scaling analysis does not affect the estimated values for the parameters but only provided that all the data points satisfy the same scaling law. We also analyse randomly generated samples where data corresponding to a particular city deviates from the scaling law followed by the rest of the cities. We then show that deviations corresponding to dragon-king cities have the most significant effect on the estimated values of the scaling parameters. The extent of this effect also depends on which estimation procedure is used. Our results have important implications on the suitability of scaling laws as a model for urban systems."

    "text": "Scaling laws are used to model how different quantifiable properties of cities, such as the number of road traffic accidents or average house prices, vary as a function of city population size, with parameters estimated from data. Arcaute et al. raised the issue of whether specific cities with extremely large population sizes, known as dragon-kings, should be considered separately from other smaller cities when estimating the scaling law parameters since the two types of cities tend to display different behaviour. Through the analysis of randomly generated samples, we find that the inclusion of dragon-kings in the scaling analysis does not affect the estimated values for the parameters but only provided that all the data points satisfy the same scaling law. We also analyse randomly generated samples where data corresponding to a particular city deviates from the scaling law followed by the rest of the cities. We then show that deviations corresponding to dragon-king cities have the most significant effect on the estimated values of the scaling parameters. The extent of this effect also depends on which estimation procedure is used. Our results have important implications on the suitability of scaling laws as a model for urban systems."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Transport systems are vulnerable to events that create disruptions. This situation is particularly sensitive in parts of Africa with a low density of highways and an increasing level of violence. Here, we measure the risk of the African transport network based on two separate indices: the intensity of future events μ and the impact ν of one event on the flow that travels through the network. To estimate the intensity of future events happening in city i, we construct a self-exciting point process. To estimate the impact of an event, we consider a network of all highways in the continent and a modelled flow between any pair of cities. Based on both indicators, we construct the μ−ν diagram and classify cities based on their combined impact and intensity. Results show that certain cities in the network have a high risk and increase the vulnerability of Africa’s infrastructure. These cities have a high propensity for suffering subsequent violence against their civilians, and given their connectivity structure, they also substantially affect the overall regional functioning. Removing just ten edges would require rerouting 32% of trips according to our model. The top 100 edges where violence might happen account for 17% of the trips. We find that cities with the highest μ−ν risk are those characterised by small and medium size and large degree, meaning they act as hubs. Vulnerable areas tend to be characterised by the presence of terrorist groups like Boko Haram in Nigeria."

Existing work has focused on countries of the Global North and restricted to the immediate effects of COVID-19 data during 2020. Data have represented a major limitation to monitor change in mobility patterns in countries in the Global South. Drawing on aggregate anonymised mobile phone location data from Meta-Facebook users, we aim to analyse the extent and persistence of changes in the levels (or intensity) and spatial patterns of internal population movement across the rural-urban continuum in Argentina, Chile and Mexico over a 26-month period from March 2020 to May 2022. We reveal an overall systematic decline in the level of short- and long-distance movement during the enactment of nonpharmaceutical interventions in 2020, with the largest reductions occurred in the most dense areas. We also show that these levels bounced back closer to pre-pandemic levels in 2022 following the relaxation of COVID-19 stringency measures. However, the intensity of these movements has remained below pre-pandemic levels in many areas in 2022. Additionally our findings lend some support to the idea of an urban exodus. They reveal a continuing negative net balances of short-distance movements in the most dense areas of capital cities in Argentina and Mexico, reflecting a pattern of suburbanisation. Chile displays limited changes in the net balance of short-distance movements but reports a net loss of long-distance movements. These losses were, however, temporary, moving to neutral and positive balances in 2021 and 2022."

It raises the need to monitor the migration in an economical, effective and timely way. Benefitting from the advancement of geolocation data collection techniques, we used near real-time and fine-grained Twitter data to monitor migration patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic, dated from January 2019 to December 2021. Based on geocoding and estimating home locations, we proposed five indices depicting migration patterns, which are demonstrated by applying an empirical study at national and local authority scales to the UK. Our findings point to complex social processes unfolding differently over space and time. In particular, the pandemic and lockdown policies significantly reduced the rate of migration. Furthermore, we found a trend of people moving out of large cities to the nearby rural areas, and also conjunctive cities if there is one, before and during the peak of the pandemic. The trend of moving to rural areas became more significant in 2020 and most people who moved out had not returned by the end of 2021, although large cities recovered more quickly than other regions. Our results of monthly migration matrixes are validated to be consistent with official migration flow data released by the Office for National Statistics, but have finer temporal granularity and can be updated more frequently. This study demonstrates that Twitter data is highly valuable for migration trend analysis despite the biases in population representation."

The intensity and patterns of internal population movements across the rural-urban hierarchy have progressively returned to pre-pandemic levels during 2021 and 2022, as has occurred in Global North countries. However, the recovery has been slower inthe large Mexican cities."

Many socio-economic indicators scale superlinearly with city size, whilst some infrastructure indicators scale sublinearly with city size.

Based on an urban network from African continental cities, we construct an algorithm to create the region of influence of cities. The number of cities and the population within a region of influence are then analysed in the context of urban scaling. Our results are compared against a random permutation of the network, showing that the observed scaling power of cities to enhance the emergence and growth of cities is not the result of randomness. By altering the radius of influence of cities, we observe three regimes. Large cities tend to be surrounded by many small towns for small distances. For medium distances (above 114 km), large cities are surrounded by many other cities containing large populations. Large cities boost urban emergence and growth (even more than 190 km away), but their scaling power decays with distance."

Both stations see approximately the same average daily number of passengers entering and exiting their gates. However, passengers are evenly distributed at A, whereas activity is concentrated mainly during peak hours at B. Although the daily travel demand is the same for both stations, B requires more resources since the number of vehicles, station dimensions and staffing level must be tailored to meet the demands of peak hours. This hypothetical scenario underscores the need to quantify the concentration of travel demand for optimising resource allocation and planning efficiency in an urban transport network. To this end, we introduce a novel metric for assessing the temporal concentration of travel demand at different locations in a generic transport network. Our approach is validated using granular data sourced from smart travel cards, encompassing 272 London Underground (LU) stations. Additionally, we present a methodological framework based on Random Forests to identify attributes of the locations of interest within the transport network that contribute to varying levels of temporal concentration of travel demand. Our case study unveils that LU stations located in areas characterised by low residential, retail, and employment density, predominantly situated in outer London, exhibit the most pronounced temporal concentration of travel demand. Conversely, within inner London, stations servicing high-density employment zones, especially around the City of London, experience a greater temporal concentration of travel demand compared to those catering to commercial and residential districts, typically situated in West London."

    "text": "Our project, DEBIAS, aims to develop a generalisable framework to quantify and adjust existing biases in Digital Footprint Data (DFD) on human mobility. To this end, we will use DFD on human mobility obtained from users of the social media platforms Facebook and X (previously Twitter), and from smartphone applications collected by the company Huq. We will use data from the UK, but our framework will be reproducible and transferable to any DF source and geographical setting. Our framework will rely on aggregate human mobility data capturing flows of people between origins and destinations. Key benefits of using this data structure are that these data are more easily accessible. They help overcome ethical concerns ensuring anonymisation and represent a common format used by data providers to share DFD on mobility.\nWhy mobility? Understanding how humans move is key to supporting appropriate policy responses to address population issues, carbon emission, urban planning, service delivery, public health and disaster management. DFD, such as location data collected from smartphone apps offer a unique opportunity to analyse population movements at high geographic and temporal granularity, with extensive coverage in near real-time. Research leveraging DFD has have a transformative impact expanding existing theories and developing new analytical tools and infrastructure of social and spatial human behaviour across the social sciences.\nChallenge: Biases in DFD have represented a major methodological barrier to reaping their benefits, contributing to scepticism and deterring wider usage of DFD. Biases mainly exist due to differences in: 1) the access and usage of the digital technologies used to collect the data (e.g. only 70% of the British population uses Facebook); and, 2) the demographic and socioeconomic profiles of users of the technology (e.g. Twitter has a young adult and male-dominated user profile mainly from urban areas). As such, human mobility data derived from DFD offer a partial representation of the overall population, limiting our capacity to draw conclusions about the overall local population.\nPromise: DEBIAS will deliver a framework to adjust biases in DF-derived mobility data and an open-source software package and training materials to implement it. These outcomes will contribute to delivering the Smart Data Research UK (SDRUK) programme aim of unlocking the power of new forms of data for research and innovation to tackle social challenges by 1) enabling the monitorisation and prediction of patterns of human mobility by facilitating robust real-time analysis based on DFs; 2) augmenting the technical social science research capacity in the use of DFD; 3) expanding existing theories and developing new explanations on spatial human behaviour by supporting research on highly granular space-time mobility patterns; and, 4) supporting the long-term access to robust and ethical DF-derived mobility data. DEBIAS will thus contribute to SDRUK-specific objectives by providing secure data access, safeguarding public trust, and building capability for cutting-edge research.\nTo maximise impact, we will engage with direct beneficiaries of our work: a) researchers and analysts; b) public sector agencies; and, c) commercial stakeholders or third sector organisations engaged in data for public good initiatives and working in mobility, transport and migration. We will establish an advisory board representing expertise from the commercial (Meta), academic (Northeastern U.) and transgovernmental (UN) sectors, to inform the development of our software tool and training materials. Working with Meta and UN-IOM will enable the exploration of opportunities for long-term strategic partnerships for data access and application of our approach to new problems. We will disseminate and increase the awareness of our work via research articles, presentations and workshops targeting different audiences and adopting open science principles."

Biases mainly exist due to differences in: 1) the access and usage of the digital technologies used to collect the data (e.g. only 70% of the British population uses Facebook); and, 2) the demographic and socioeconomic profiles of users of the technology (e.g. Twitter has a young adult and male-dominated user profile mainly from urban areas). As such, human mobility data derived from DFD offer a partial representation of the overall population, limiting our capacity to draw conclusions about the overall local population.\nPromise: DEBIAS will deliver a framework to adjust biases in DF-derived mobility data and an open-source software package and training materials to implement it. These outcomes will contribute to delivering the Smart Data Research UK (SDRUK) programme aim of unlocking the power of new forms of data for research and innovation to tackle social challenges by 1) enabling the monitorisation and prediction of patterns of human mobility by facilitating robust real-time analysis based on DFs; 2) augmenting the technical social science research capacity in the use of DFD; 3) expanding existing theories and developing new explanations on spatial human behaviour by supporting research on highly granular space-time mobility patterns; and, 4) supporting the long-term access to robust and ethical DF-derived mobility data. DEBIAS will thus contribute to SDRUK-specific objectives by providing secure data access, safeguarding public trust, and building capability for cutting-edge research.\nTo maximise impact, we will engage with direct beneficiaries of our work: a) researchers and analysts; b) public sector agencies; and, c) commercial stakeholders or third sector organisations engaged in data for public good initiatives and working in mobility, transport and migration. We will establish an advisory board representing expertise from the commercial (Meta), academic (Northeastern U.) and transgovernmental (UN) sectors, to inform the development of our software tool and training materials. Working with Meta and UN-IOM will enable the exploration of opportunities for long-term strategic partnerships for data access and application of our approach to new problems. We will disseminate and increase the awareness of our work via research articles, presentations and workshops targeting different audiences and adopting open science principles."
