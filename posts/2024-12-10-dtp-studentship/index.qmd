I’m seeking prospective PhD students passionate about exploring topics at the intersection of human mobility, socio-environmental sustainability, and social justice through cutting-edge data science research, particularly in urban contexts. Possible projects include:

1️⃣ Investigating how interactions between diverse urban groups influence social cohesion and inclusivity\
2️⃣ Examining the relationship between urban mobility and environmental sustainability\
3️⃣ A combination of the above!
