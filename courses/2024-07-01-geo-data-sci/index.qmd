**Description:** This module will introduce students to the field of Geographic Data Science (GDS), a discipline established at the intersection between Geographic Information Science (GIS) and Data Science. The course covers how the modern GIS toolkit can be integrated with Data Science tools to solve practical real-world problems. Much of the course material is inspired by Dani Arribas-Belâ€™s course on Geographic Data Science.

**Contents:**<br>
1. Introduction<br>
2. Spatial Data<br>
3. Mapping Vector Data<br>
4. Mapping Raster Data<br>
5. Points<br>
6. Spatial Weights<br>
7. ESDA<br>
8. Clustering<br>
9. Spatial Netowrks<br>

**Delivery:** as part of the BA in Geogrpahy and the MSc in Geographic Data Science at the University of Liverpool.
